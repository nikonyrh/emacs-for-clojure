# this is a (forked) Clojure-friendly emacs config

Most files here originate from [this introductory tutorial](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/),
you should check it out! I intend to add here my own customizations, and maintan a list of shortcuts
which I find useful (and keep forgetting for now).

## WARNING

This project uses an outdated version of
[CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider), the package that
provides much of the functionality for Clojure development. If you run
into issues, try upgrading (instructions below).

Why not just update this package to use the latest CIDER, you ask?
This project uses CIDER 0.8.1 so that
[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/)
readers are less likely to get confused as they use Emacs for the
first time.
